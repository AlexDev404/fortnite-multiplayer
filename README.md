Hi there.
This is such an unexpected release but we have finally chosen to open source this project, even if we are sure someone will download it and just let their own fans play it with no recognition to us.

As the project is going to be OSS, everyone can contribute by making his own issues / pull requests to improve the code and make a better gameplay to be enjoyable.


<h3 align="center">We please ask you to contribute if you can, report issues as we are going to still work on this.</h3>
